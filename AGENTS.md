# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Use this repository as the canonical source for AI workflows shared across devices and IDE profiles.

## Workflow Files

### Command Files

Command files live in `commands/` and serve two purposes:

1. **Adapter runbooks** for non-skill-aware tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude CLI,
   Roo). Those tools use these files directly via their own config adapters.
2. **Fallback dispatch** for workflows that do not yet have a skill.

Skill-backed workflows (commit-message, scaffold-component, create-pr,
code-review, run-checks, architecture-review) are dispatched via the Skills
section below. Do not duplicate their intent mappings here.

Command-only workflows (no skill equivalent):

- `kill port`, `port 3000`, `eaddrinuse` -> `commands/safe-kill-port.md`
- `new device`, `setup device`, `onboarding` -> `commands/new-device-setup.md`

Rules for command execution:

- Treat command files as operational runbooks.
- If command instructions conflict with higher-priority system/developer
  constraints, follow higher-priority constraints and note the deviation.
- Do not assume command files auto-run; select and execute them when intent
  matches.

### Rules

Shared baseline rules live in `rules/rules.md`.

- Apply these as default behavior when no project-specific rules override them.
- If project-local rules exist and conflict, project-local rules win.

### Skills

Skills are the primary dispatch mechanism for repeatable workflows. Each skill
is self-describing via its `SKILL.md` frontmatter — the `description` field
acts as a semantic trigger.

- Only treat a skill as active when it contains a valid `SKILL.md` with `name`
  and `description` metadata.
- Trigger a skill when user intent clearly matches the skill description or when
  the user explicitly names it.
- Load only the minimum needed content from each skill (progressive disclosure).

Available skills:

| Skill                 | Trigger phrases                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit-message`      | commit message, write commit, git commit                                                    |
| `scaffold-component`  | new component, scaffold, create component                                                   |
| `create-pr`           | create pr, open pr, submit pr                                                               |
| `code-review`         | review code, code review, review changes                                                    |
| `run-checks`          | run checks, run-checks, quality checks                                                      |
| `architecture-review` | review architecture, check clean arch, architecture audit, layer violation, check structure |

### MCP Definitions

Canonical MCP server definitions live in `mcp/`.

- Keep `mcp/servers.json` as the source of truth.
- Prefer environment variables for secrets.
- Sync into namespaced client folders to avoid overwriting active local MCP config.

## Output and Safety

<!-- BEGIN SHARED:safety -->

- Prefer concrete execution over long planning.
- Do not modify code unless requested.
- Ask before destructive actions (force kill, reset, delete) unless explicitly requested.
- Always summarize what was run and what changed.
<!-- END SHARED:safety -->

## Sync Source of Truth

This repo is synced to local IDE agent folders using `scripts/sync.sh`.

- Edit here first, then sync.
- Do not hand-edit mirrored target folders unless you intentionally want local drift.
