# AGENTS.md

Read `AI-WORKFLOWS.md` for how this project's AI workflow files are intended to work together.
Read `CONVENTIONS.md` for project-specific context, stack, structure, and conventions.
Read `rules/` for baseline coding standards (shared across all projects).
Load only the relevant focused rule files for the task:

- `rules/tailwind.md` for styling and design-token work
- `rules/testing.md` for tests and test reviews
- `rules/accessibility.md` for interactive UI and accessibility checks
- `rules/type-safety.md` for TypeScript-heavy work, trust boundaries, and runtime validation checks
- `rules/backlog.md` for user stories, specs, and backlog work
- `rules/content-blocks.md` for CMS-backed block architecture, transforms, and block-specific checklists
- `rules/payload.md` for Payload schema, generated-type, and integration work
- the appropriate `rules/stacks/*` file after detecting the stack from `package.json`

## Precedence

1. `CONVENTIONS.md` (project-specific conventions)
2. `rules/` (baseline coding standards)
3. This file (workflow dispatch)

When CONVENTIONS.md conflicts with rules/, CONVENTIONS.md wins.

## Workflow Dispatch

### Skills

Skills are the primary dispatch mechanism for repeatable workflows on
skill-aware tools. Treat them as the canonical workflow source when available.

| Skill            | Trigger phrases                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `commit-message` | commit message, write commit, git commit |
| `create-pr`      | create pr, open pr, submit pr            |
| `close-sprint`   | close sprint, sluit sprint af, sprint afsluiten |
| `sprint-demo`    | sprint demo, demo voorbereiden, demo script, prepare demo |
| `sprint-planning` | sprint planning, plan sprint, sprint start, start sprint, plan komende sprint |

### Commands

Commands in `commands/` remain compatibility adapters and fallback runbooks,
especially for Copilot-style flows or when a skill path is unavailable.

## Shared Workflow Source

Changes to shared AI workflow assets should usually be proposed upstream in
the [ai-workflows](https://gitlab.com/greenberrynl/config/ai-workflows) repo instead of living only in this synced target repo.

Treat these as shared workflow assets:

<!-- BEGIN SHARED:workflow-assets -->
- `AI-WORKFLOWS.md`
- `commands/**`
- `rules/**`
- `.github/prompts/**`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/rules/**`
<!-- END SHARED:workflow-assets -->

When a task changes those files in a generally reusable way, proactively
suggest creating a PR in `ai-workflows` so the change can be synced back into
target repos.

### Command Runbooks

When user intent matches a trigger phrase, read and follow the corresponding runbook in `commands/`.

<!-- BEGIN SHARED:command-mappings -->
- `create pr`, `open pr`, `submit pr` -> `commands/create-pr.md`
- `commit message`, `write commit`, `git commit` -> `commands/commit-message.md`
- `close sprint`, `sluit sprint af`, `sprint afsluiten` -> `commands/close-sprint.md`
- `sprint demo`, `demo voorbereiden`, `demo script`, `prepare demo` -> `commands/sprint-demo.md`
- `sprint planning`, `plan sprint`, `sprint start`, `start sprint`, `plan komende sprint` -> `commands/sprint-planning.md`
<!-- END SHARED:command-mappings -->

Do not assume command files auto-run. Select and execute them when intent matches.

## Safety

<!-- BEGIN SHARED:safety -->
- Prefer concrete execution over long planning.
- Do not modify code unless requested.
- Ask before destructive actions (force kill, reset, delete) unless explicitly requested.
- Always summarize what was run and what changed.
<!-- END SHARED:safety -->
