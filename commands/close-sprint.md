# Close Sprint Runbook

Canonical runbook for closing out a sprint. The `close-sprint` skill on
skill-aware tools wraps this runbook; Codex, Copilot, and other prompt-first
tools should follow these steps directly.

Goal: produce a sprint changelog, a gaps/spillover document, and move the
delivered backlog items into a dedicated sprint folder. Jira is read-only
throughout — never edit issues, transitions, or comments.

## Safety

- **Never** mutate Jira (no comments, transitions, edits, assignments).
- **Never** run `git commit` — the user commits themselves.
- Use `git mv` to relocate files so history is preserved.
- Stop and ask when classification is ambiguous; do not guess.

## Inputs

Ask the user at start:

1. Sprint name or id (e.g. `Sprint 2`).
2. Assignee email (default: the configured Jira user, verify with `jira me`).
3. Jira project key (infer from existing backlog filenames, e.g. `RFW`).

## Phase 0 — Switch to the integration branch

Closing a sprint means reporting what landed on the **integration branch**
(`development` by default — confirm the project's main branch if unsure). Run
the whole flow from there, not from a feature branch:

1. Verify a clean working tree (`git status --short`); stop and ask if dirty.
2. Check out the integration branch and bring it up to date with the remote:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git fetch origin
   git pull --ff-only
   ```
   `--ff-only` is non-destructive (it only advances a strictly-behind local
   branch). If it refuses because local has diverged, stop and ask.
3. All later phases — code verification (Phase 2), `git mv` of delivered BLIs
   (Phase 5), and the cleanup overview (Phase 8) — run from this up-to-date
   branch. A feature branch is ahead of `development` and will misclassify
   delivered vs spillover work and operate on the wrong `docs/` tree.

## Phase 1 — Fetch Jira tickets (read-only)

A live Jira connection is a **hard precondition** — closing a sprint on local
docs alone produces an inaccurate changelog. Use the **most efficient method
available**: the **Atlassian MCP** if it is connected (preferred), otherwise the
**`jira` CLI** (`ankitpokhrel/jira-cli`). If neither connects, **stop** and help
the user connect before continuing (MCP: authenticate the Atlassian connector;
CLI: `brew install ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/jira-cli` then `jira init`). Never fall
back to local-only.

With the CLI:

```bash
# Verify config
jira me

# List active sprints (to confirm sprint name)
jira sprint list --state active --plain

# Tickets in the target sprint on the user's name
jira issue list --plain --no-truncate \
  -a "<assignee-email>" \
  --jql 'sprint = "Sprint 2" AND project = RFW'

# Per-ticket detail (assignee, status, summary, links)
jira issue view RFW-XX --plain
```

With the MCP, query the same set by JQL and request status, assignee,
fixVersion, and linked issues.

Capture for each ticket: key, summary, Jira status, assignee, fixVersion,
linked issues.

## Phase 2 — Code verification

For each ticket:

1. Locate the BLI: `docs/backlog/<TICKET>-*.md` (also check `docs/refine/`,
   `docs/plans/`, `docs/specs/`).
2. Check commits on the main integration branch:
   ```bash
   git log --all --grep="<TICKET>" --format="%h %s %an <%ae>"
   ```
3. Note PR / branch existence if discoverable.
4. Classify the ticket:
   - `delivered` — code is on the integration branch and matches the BLI.
   - `partial` — some code merged, scope not fully covered.
   - `spillover` — ticket exists, no merged code, work continues next sprint.
   - `not-started` — ticket exists, no code, no docs.
   - `code-without-ticket` — code references exist without a matching Jira key
     (surface during Phase 4b).

## Phase 3 — Draft the sprint changelog

Create `docs/sprint-<N>-changelog.md` mirroring the structure of
`docs/sprint-1-changelog.md`:

- Short intro paragraph.
- `## Delivered in Sprint <N>` — markdown table with columns `Ticket`,
  `Backlogitem`, `Opgeleverd`. Include **only** `delivered` items.
- `## Review Evidence` — bullet list of grouped code paths that reviewers can
  open to verify delivery.

## Phase 4 — Draft the gaps and spillover document

Create `docs/sprint-<N>-gaps.md` with these sections:

### 4a. Spillover

Tickets classified `partial`, `spillover`, or `not-started`. Per item:

- Jira key + summary
- Current Jira status
- BLI path (or `none`)
- Observed code state (files touched, partial implementation notes)
- Open question or proposed next action

### 4b. Gaps Jira ↔ Code

- Code merged this sprint without a matching Jira ticket
- Tickets without a BLI or spec
- BLIs without a Jira ticket

### 4c. BLI / Doc mismatches

BLIs whose acceptance criteria diverge from what actually shipped. Note the
divergence — do not rewrite the BLI yet (that happens after review).

## Phase 5 — Move delivered BLIs into the sprint folder

For each ticket classified `delivered`:

1. `git mv docs/backlog/<TICKET>-*.md docs/sprint-<N>/<TICKET>-*.md`
   (create `docs/sprint-<N>/` if missing).
2. Update the BLI:
   - `## Status` → `Delivered in Sprint <N>.`
   - `## Authors` → populate from Jira assignee plus git commit authors.
     - Primary: assignee from `jira issue view <TICKET> --plain`.
     - Additional: unique committers from
       `git log --all --grep="<TICKET>" --format="%an <%ae>" | sort -u`.
     - Deduplicate against existing entries; never remove existing authors.
     - Format:
       ```markdown
       ## Authors

       - Wieteke Pots <wieteke.pots@greenberry.nl>
       ```

Spillover and partial BLIs stay in `docs/backlog/` or `docs/refine/` — do not
move them.

## Phase 6 — Review pause (stop here)

Print a summary:

- Path to the changelog
- Path to the gaps document
- List of moved BLIs
- Count of spillover / gap items awaiting review

Then stop and ask the user to review the changelog and gaps document before
continuing. Do not proceed to Phase 7 without explicit acknowledgement.

## Phase 7 — Spillover walkthrough (after user ack)

Walk through each gap item with the user. For spillover work without an
adequate doc:

1. Ask where the new md belongs (`docs/refine/`, `docs/todo/`,
   `docs/backlog/`).
2. Create the new md using the relevant template (e.g.
   `docs/backlog/_template.md` for a new backlog item).
3. Pre-fill Ticket, Authors, User Story, and Acceptance Criteria from Jira
   plus the observations gathered in Phase 2.
4. Update `docs/sprint-<N>-gaps.md` with the resolution (link to the new doc
   or recorded decision).

## Phase 8 — Stale branches and worktrees overview

Produce a cleanup report. Do **not** delete anything — only surface candidates
for the user to act on.

### 8a. Collect branch and worktree state

```bash
# Local branches with last commit date and merge status against development
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)|%(committerdate:iso8601)|%(committerdate:relative)' refs/heads/

# Branches fully merged into development
git branch --merged development

# Worktrees
git worktree list
```

### 8b. Classify each branch

**Always exclude protected branches** from the cleanup overview entirely —
never list them, never suggest actions for them. Protected branches:

- `main`
- `master`
- `development`
- `acceptance`
- `staging`
- `production`
- the branch currently checked out

For every remaining local branch:

- `merged-stale` — merged into `development` and last commit > 14 days ago.
  Safe-delete candidate.
- `delivered-this-sprint` — matches a ticket in the changelog (e.g.
  `feature/RFW-52-*`). Safe-delete candidate once the user confirms the PR
  is closed/merged.
- `spillover-active` — matches a ticket in the gaps document. **Keep.**
- `unmerged-old` — not merged, last commit > 30 days ago. Flag for user
  decision.
- `active` — recent commits within the last 14 days, no decision needed.

### 8c. Classify each worktree

- `review-tmp` — path under `/tmp` or `/private/tmp` with detached HEAD.
  Safe to remove once review is done.
- `branch-gone` — worktree references a branch that no longer exists or is
  merged.
- `active` — matches a current working branch.

### 8d. Write the cleanup overview

Append a `## Stale branches and worktrees` section to
`docs/sprint-<N>-gaps.md` (so all sprint-close output lives in one review
document):

- Table of stale branches: `Branch`, `Last commit`, `Classification`,
  `Suggested action`.
- Table of stale worktrees: `Path`, `Branch / HEAD`, `Classification`,
  `Suggested action`.
- Footer with the exact commands the user can run to clean up — but do not
  execute them:
  ```bash
  git worktree remove <path>
  git branch -d <branch>      # safe delete (merged only)
  git branch -D <branch>      # force delete (unmerged) — confirm first
  ```

Ask the user before deleting anything. Branch and worktree deletion is
destructive — never run these commands without explicit per-item approval.

## Output

End with a concise list of:

- Files written
- Files moved (via `git mv`)
- New docs created during Phase 7
- Stale branch / worktree count from Phase 8
- Items still open that need user follow-up
