# Rules Index

This directory contains focused rule files. Load the relevant file(s) for the current context.

| File                          | Covers                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `communication.md`            | Tone, response style, problem-solving approach                      |
| `project.md`                  | React, Next.js, TypeScript, component design, naming                |
| `tailwind.md`                 | Tailwind 4, design tokens, Figma export workflow                    |
| `testing.md`                  | Jest + Storybook split, query priority, coverage                    |
| `accessibility.md`            | WCAG requirements, ARIA, keyboard navigation                        |
| `clean-architecture.md`       | Layer principles, dependency rules, forbidden patterns (all stacks) |
| `stacks/nextjs-payload.md`    | Folder mapping + conventions for Next.js + Payload                  |
| `stacks/react-native-expo.md` | Folder mapping + conventions for React Native + Expo                |

## Loading Priority

1. Load `communication.md` always — baseline behavior.
2. Load `project.md` when no project-local rules exist.
3. Load `clean-architecture.md` whenever writing or reviewing code.
4. Load `tailwind.md` when working on styles or design tokens.
5. Load `testing.md` when writing or reviewing tests.
6. Load `accessibility.md` when building interactive UI components.
7. Load the appropriate stack file based on detected stack (see below).

## Stack Detection

Before loading a stack file, read the project's `package.json` and check
`dependencies` + `devDependencies`:

- `"next"` present → load `stacks/nextjs-payload.md`
  (also applies when `@payloadcms/payload` is present alongside Next.js)
- `"expo"` or `"react-native"` present → load `stacks/react-native-expo.md`
- Neither detected → apply `clean-architecture.md` principles only; do not
  assume any folder structure

## Structure Probe Directive

When applying stack rules to an **existing project**, do not assume canonical
folder names. Instead:

1. List the top-level directories inside `src/` (or the project root if no
   `src/` exists).
2. Map each detected folder to a CA layer using the mapping table in the
   relevant stack file.
3. If a folder cannot be classified from the table, inspect a sample of its
   files to determine what it imports.
4. Ask the user to classify any folder that remains ambiguous.
5. Only then check CA principles against the resolved mapping.

Never report a violation based on a folder name mismatch. Report violations
based on **principle breaches** within the resolved layer mapping.

## Conflict Resolution

- Project-local rules always win over these baseline rules.
- `communication.md` wins over project rules only for tone and response style.
- Stack rules are additive — they extend `clean-architecture.md`, never
  contradict it.
